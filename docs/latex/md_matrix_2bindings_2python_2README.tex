If you have a different than the standard wiring (for instance if you have an Adafruit HAT), you can edit the \href{../../lib/Makefile\#L26}{\texttt{ ../../lib/\+Makefile}} first to choose the hardware in question (see below for setting it via command line argument).

Then, in the root directory for the matrix library simply type\+:\hypertarget{md_matrix_2bindings_2python_2README_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Python 3}{Python 3}}\label{md_matrix_2bindings_2python_2README_autotoc_md11}

The cython binding to Py\+Py seems to be somewhat working but extremely slow (20x slower even than the regular Python binding, 160x slower than C++), so this is not recommended.

So Cython is not good together with Py\+Py which works best with a \href{https://cffi.readthedocs.io/}{\texttt{ CFFI}} binding. @\+Duality4Y did an experiment here \href{https://github.com/Duality4Y/rgb-matrix-cffi}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Duality4\+Y/rgb-\/matrix-\/cffi}} which works well with Py\+Py and is about twice as fast as running Python3+cython (but Python3+cffi is slower than Python3+cython, so we can\textquotesingle{}t just replace everything with cffi).

Of course, it would be nice to have the fastest possible binding to all kinds of Python interpreters. If anyone wants to work on that, this would certainly be a welcome pull request.\hypertarget{md_matrix_2bindings_2python_2README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Performance}{Performance}}\label{md_matrix_2bindings_2python_2README_autotoc_md13}
The simplicity of scripting comes at a price\+: Python is slower than C++ of course. If you have to do a lot of pixel updates in your demo, this can be too slow depending on what you do. Here are some rough numbers for calling {\ttfamily Set\+Pixel()} in a tight loop\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On a Pi-\/2 and Pi-\/3, a Python script will be about 1/8 of the speed compared to the corresponding C++ program (pushing \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}0.43 Megapixels/s Python vs. \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}3.5 Megapixels/s C++ on a Pi-\/3 for instance)
\item On a Pi-\/1/\+Pi Zero, the difference is even worse\+: 1/24 of the speed to the corresponding C++ program. Given that this Pi is already about 1/10 the speed of a Pi-\/3, this almost makes Python unusable on a Pi-\/1 (\texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}0.015 Megapixels/s Python vs. \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}0.36 Megapixels/s C++)
\item Also interesting\+: Python3 is a little bit slower than Python2.\+7. So if you can, stick with Python2.\+7 for now.
\item The good news is, that this is due to overhead per function call. If you can do more per function call, then this is less problematic. For instance if you have an image to be displayed with {\ttfamily Set\+Image()}, that will much faster per pixel (internally this then copies the pixels natively).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}0.015 Megapixels/s on a Pi-\/1 means that you can update a 32x32 matrix at most with \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}15fps. If you have chained 5, then you barely reach 3fps. In a Pi-\/3, you get about 400fps update rate (85fps for 5-\/chain) with a Python program (while with C++, you can do the same thing with a comfortable 3500fps (700fps for 5)). Keep in mind that this is if all you do is just calling {\ttfamily Set\+Pixel()}, it does not include any time of what you actually want to do in your demo -\/ so anything in addition to that will drop your update rate.

If you can prepare the animation you want to show, then you can either prepare images and then use the much faster call to {\ttfamily Set\+Image()}, or can fill entire offscreen-\/frames (create with {\ttfamily Create\+Frame\+Canvas()}) and then swap with {\ttfamily Swap\+On\+VSync()} (this is the fastest method).\hypertarget{md_matrix_2bindings_2python_2README_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Using the library}{Using the library}}\label{md_matrix_2bindings_2python_2README_autotoc_md14}
Be aware of the fact that using the full performance of the RGBMatrix requires root privileges. Therefore you should run all you python scripts as using {\ttfamily sudo}.

You may find examples in the \href{./samples}{\texttt{ samples/}} subdirectory. The examples all use the \href{./samples/samplebase.py}{\texttt{ samplebase.\+py}} that provides some basic capabilities to all example programs, such as command-\/line parsing\+: all sample-\/programs accept {\ttfamily -\/-\/led-\/rows}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/led-\/chain} and {\ttfamily -\/-\/led-\/parallel} as command line options to adapt to your configuration

\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ./runtext.py\ -\/-\/led-\/chain=4}

\end{DoxyCode}


To use different wiring without recompiling the library to change the default, you can use {\ttfamily -\/-\/led-\/gpio-\/mapping} (or {\ttfamily -\/m}). For example, to use Adafruit HAT\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ./runtext.py\ -\/-\/led-\/gpio-\/mapping=adafruit-\/hat}

\end{DoxyCode}

As noted in the Performance section above, Python programs not run as {\ttfamily root} will not be as high-\/performance as those run as {\ttfamily root}. When running as {\ttfamily root}, be aware of a potentially-\/unexpected behavior\+: to reduce the security attack surface, initializing an RGBMatrix as {\ttfamily root} changes the user from {\ttfamily root} to {\ttfamily daemon} (see \href{https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/1170}{\texttt{ \#1170}} for more information) by default. This means, for instance, that some file operations possible before initializing the RGBMatrix will not be possible after initialization. To disable this behavior, set {\ttfamily drop\+\_\+privileges=False} in RGBMatrix\+Options, but be aware that doing so will reduce security.
