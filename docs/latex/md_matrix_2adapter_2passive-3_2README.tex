\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is a passive board. It is simple, but the logic level will be out of spec for the LED matrix (3.\+3V vs. 5V) which might or might not work. Driving long cables with the GPIO pins is also not a good idea.
\item You typically want to consider using the \href{../active-3}{\texttt{ active board}}.
\item Works for Matrix up to 1\+:16 multiplexing (32 rows). For 1\+:32 multiplexing, you want to use the \href{../active-3}{\texttt{ active board}}. You can of also hack this board as \href{https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/360\#issuecomment-321104348}{\texttt{ suggested in this bugtracker entry}} to make it work with 64x64 boards.
\item Only really advisable, if the LED panels have 74HCT245 (as opposed to just 74HC245) in their input stage, because then they can deal properly with the 3.\+3V logic levels coming from the Pi.
\item Supports up to three panel chains for newer plus models and Raspberry Pi 2/3 that have 40 GPIO pins.
\item Open source Ki\+CAD PCB EDA format.
\item (not very pretty layout, was just lazy and let the auto-\/router do it).
\item The FAB files are provided as \href{./passive3-rpi-hub75-adapter-fab.zip}{\texttt{ passive3-\/rpi-\/hub75-\/adapter-\/fab.\+zip}}
