\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Passive board. Simple, but might need to define {\ttfamily -\/-\/led-\/slowdown-\/gpio} if you see glitches.
\item Supports one panel connected to a 26 pin Raspberry Pi 1. If you have a newer RPi, check out the \href{../passive-3}{\texttt{ Passive 3}} or \href{../active-3}{\texttt{ Active 3}} adapter.
\item Open source Ki\+CAD PCB EDA format.
\item (not very pretty layout, was just lazy and let the auto-\/router do it).
\item The FAB files are provided as \href{./passive-rpi-hub75-adapter-fab.zip}{\texttt{ passive-\/rpi-\/hub75-\/adapter-\/fab.\+zip}}
